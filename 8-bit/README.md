# 8-Bit

The given program displays a series of red, green, blue, yellow, magenta, and cyan designs. It reads data in from a file, making it easier to modify what is drawn.

Your job is to play around with this way of drawing:
* Look at `scene.txt` in `src/art` and compare it with the graphics display.
* Read through the `Engine::readFromFile` to see how it works.
    * Also notice the const `SIDE_LENGTH` field in `engine.h`. Change it to different values to see the effect.
* Modify `scene.txt` to create a custom drawing.
* Modify the code to interact with the scene in different ways.

You have 30 minutes to work on this activity. After that time is up, we will have everyone share what they have: everyone will run their programs and walk around to see what other people made.
